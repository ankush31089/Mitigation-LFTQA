For Chevrolet, the drivers are Darrell Waltrip (210.471 mph), Dale Earnhardt (210.360 mph), and Terry Labonte (210.101 mph). The average speed for Chevrolet is (210.471 + 210.360 + 210.101) / 3 = 210.311 mph. For Ford, the drivers are Bill Elliott (212.809 mph), Davey Allison (210.610 mph), and Kyle Petty (210.346 mph). The average speed for Ford is (212.809 + 210.610 + 210.346) / 3 = 211.255 mph. Therefore, Ford drivers had a higher average speed across their manufacturer in the race."}
